This document contains some annotated examples of problematic syntax elements which need to be fixed, and for which there aren't any proper Sublime Text syntax tests yet.


== Tables

There are still some problems with tables, especially with cell delimiters with _cell specifiers_ containing special characters (e.g. ``.*+^``), because some of them are being parsed as quote markup -- and chances are that even those which aren't problematic now will become a problem later on, when we enable all supported elements inside tables; so we need to keep an eye on these advanced cell delimiters.

We need to capture tables -- from their opening `|===` delimiter to the closing delimiter -- so that we can properly match cell delimiters with special characters, thus preventing the syntax from breaking up.
